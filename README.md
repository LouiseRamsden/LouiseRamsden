## Hi I'm Louise!

### About me
I'm a graphics programmer, tech artist and game dev studying at uni with a primary focus on Computer Graphics.
I plan to do some embedded systems programming as a hobby.
Working on a few custom engines, tools and renderers.
I will get around to organising my public repos with nice README's eventually but I'm very busy with uni work currently.

### Graphics APIs
#### Modern Low Level Graphics APIs:
- Vulkan: Still Struggling
- DX12: Comfortable working in
#### Higher Level Modern APIs:
- Modern OpenGL: Comfortable
- DX11: Comfortable
#### Older APIs
- DX9: Only used once
- OpenGL 1.x: sadly too knowledgable in just I refuse to use GLUT, but who uses that anyway...

### Languages I use
- C++: primarily
- C: often
- C#: too much
- HLSL/GLSL/CG: not enough
- Rust: barely notable
- ASM(6502/x86/Mips): hopefully more soon

### Personal project naming scheme
- &lt;bird I like(or thing I like)&gt; - &lt;project type&gt;
