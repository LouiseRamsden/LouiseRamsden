## Hi I'm Louise!

### About me
I'm a graphics programmer, tech artist and game dev studying at uni with a primary focus on Computer Graphics.
I plan to do some embedded systems programming as a hobby.
Working on a few custom engines, tools and renderers.
I will get around to organising my public repos with nice README's eventually but I'm very busy with uni work currently.

### Graphics APIs
Older API's such as OpenGL 1-current, DX9-DX11, immediate context apis in general I'm confident with.
Newer graphics API's (eg: vulkan, dx12, metal) I am less confident in but actively learning currently.

### Languages I use
- C++: primarily
- C: often
- C#: too much
- HLSL/GLSL/CG: not enough
- Rust: barely notable
- ASM(6502/x86/Mips): hopefully more soon

### Personal project naming scheme
- &lt;bird I like(or thing I like)&gt; - &lt;project type&gt;
